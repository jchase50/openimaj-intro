Introduction to OpenIMAJ lib for video processing

This project has branches '[00-baseline](https://github.com/jchase50/openimaj-intro/tree/00-baseline)' through 'nn-*' that walk through how to get started with OpenIMAJ. This project focuses specifically on getting started with OpenIMAJ for video. I tried to not repeat the [OpenIMAJ tutorial](http://openimaj.org/tutorial/). The OpenIMAJ tutorial is a great place to start to get a full picture of capabilities of OpenIMAJ.
