# openimaj-intro
Introduction to OpenImaj lib

This project has branches '00-baseline' through 'NN-*' that walk through how to get started with openimaj. This project focuses specifically on getting started with openimaj for video. I tried to not repeat the [openimaj tutorial](http://openimaj.org/tutorial/). The openimaj tutorial is a great place to start to get a full picture of capabilities of openimaj.
